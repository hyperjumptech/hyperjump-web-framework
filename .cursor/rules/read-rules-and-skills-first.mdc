# Read Rules & Skills Before Coding

**Before writing or editing any code**, you MUST:

1. **Read all glob-matched rules** in `.cursor/rules/` that apply to the file types you are about to create or edit (e.g. `typescript-javascript-standards.mdc` for `.ts`/`.tsx` files).
2. **Read every skill referenced** by those rules (e.g. if a rule says "Use the /react-component skill", read that skill file immediately).
3. **Only then** begin writing code, ensuring every standard is applied on the first pass.

```
❌ BAD — write code, then retroactively fix standards
1. Create component
2. User points out missing JSDoc / tests / arrow functions
3. Spend extra tokens fixing

✅ GOOD — read rules first, write correct code once
1. Read typescript-javascript-standards.mdc
2. Read react-component skill, vitest-unit-testing skill
3. Create component following all standards (arrow fn, JSDoc, DI, tests)
```
